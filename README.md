## ðŸ‘‹ intro

Welcome to my Fish shell dot files!
It in general should be quite similar to stock Fish but with some nice sugar :)

## âœ¨ feats

- Show a **IS THAT POKÃ‰MON?** when starting the shell
- **_Tries_** to auto-install [starship](https://starship.rs) and [zoxide](https://ajeetdsouza/zoxide) and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)!
- Fancy prompts via [starship](https://starship.rs)
- Smarter `cd` with [zoxide](https://ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
- Just [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)!
- Configured vi mode!
- Fancy `ls` with [lsd](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd)
- Automagically `ls` on `cd`!
